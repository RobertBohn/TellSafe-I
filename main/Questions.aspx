									<a name="#faq1"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">What is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to the auditing 
									scandals at major U.S. companies like Enron and Worldcom. The law is designed 
									to ensure that company officials behave responsibly. One of the requirements of 
									Sarbanes-Oxley is that employees who have information of financial misconduct 
									can anonymously send that information to independent Audit Committees, or to 
									outside authorities and the media.
