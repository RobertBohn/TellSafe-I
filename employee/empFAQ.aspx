									<a name="#faq1"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">What is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to the auditing 
									scandals at major U.S. companies like Enron and Worldcom. The law is designed 
									to ensure that company officials behave responsibly. One of the requirements of 
									Sarbanes-Oxley is that employees who have information of financial misconduct 
									can anonymously send that information to independent Audit Committees, or to 
									outside authorities and the media.

									<br>
									<a name="#faq2"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">What are my rights?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									By law, your company can't discriminate against you in any way for reporting 
									financial misconduct. If you believe that you have been discriminated against, 
									you should immediately report this to your Human Resources department. The 
									beauty of Compliant™ is that it lets you submit an anonymous report without any 
									fear of reprisal.
									<br>
									<br>

									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq3"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">What should I know about Compliant™?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Compliant™ was created for your peace of mind, and we have many options for 
									you. You can submit a report at our website. Our operators can take your report 
									over the phone 24 hours a day. If you prefer to submit a printed report, you 
									can reach us by courier or by U.S. mail.
									<br>
									<br>
									You should be sure to attach all documents along with your submission. If you 
									call our operator, he or she will give you instructions for submitting 
									additional materials.

									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq4"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">How can I be sure my report is anonymous?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Compliant™ uses many safeguards to maintain your anonymity:
									<br>
									<br>
									1. Your web report isn't submitted as an email, but as an encrypted form.
									<br>
									<br>
									2. When you call our report number, the operator taking your call has no 
									connection to TellSafe or to your company.
									<br>
									<br>
									3. You seal written reports in a second envelope inside the mailing envelope, 
									so reports are sealed when they reach your Audit Committee.
									<br>

									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq5"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">Will anyone at TellSafe know that I 
										submitted a report?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									No one on the TellSafe staff has access to the identity of an employee who 
									makes a report. All reports, Usernames and Passwords are encrypted in the 
									database.
									<br>
									<br>
									<center><a href="#top">top</a></center>
									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq6"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">Why am I given a confirmation number?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Compliant™ issues you a confirmation number as a reference for any future 
									reports. If you submit one report in March and submit a second report in May, 
									you may want to reference your first report.
									<br>
									<br>
									<center><a href="#top">top</a></center>
									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq7"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">Who will see my report?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Only the members of your company's Audit Committee will see your report. If you 
									make accusations of financial misconduct, your company is bound by law to 
									review those charges.
									<br>
									<br>
									<center><a href="#top">top</a></center>
									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq8"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">Who is on the Audit Committee?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									The Audit Committee is a group of people appointed by your Board of Directors. 
									In the event that your company doesn't appoint the Audit Committee, your Board 
									of Directors will be considered the Audit Committee.
									<br>
									<br>
									<center><a href="#top">top</a></center>
									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq9"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">What is the purpose of the Audit Committee?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Your company's Audit Committee is responsible for investigating any reports of 
									financial misconduct.
									<br>
									<br>

									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq10"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">What happens when I submit a report?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									When you submit a report, Compliant™ sends your company's Audit Committee an 
									email notification that a report has been submitted. Compliant™ files the 
									report until the contact(s) log in and retrieve it.
									<br>
									<br>
									<center><a href="#top">top</a></center>
									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq11"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">How do I submit a report by phone?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Call the Compliant™ toll-free number at 1-800-475-4358, and an operator will 
									type your report into the form on our website. The operator will read back the 
									text of the report so that you can make any changes, and give you a 
									confirmation number.

									<br>

									<br>
									<br>
									<a name="#faq12"></a><SPAN CLASS="adH1">How should I mail a printed report?</SPAN>
									<br>
									<br>
									Send your printed material in an envelope and print the name of your company on 
									the envelope. Put that envelope inside a mailing envelope and send the package 
									to our processing center at:
